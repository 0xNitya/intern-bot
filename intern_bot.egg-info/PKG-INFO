```
and
```

# so smth like: ...python3.**/site-packages/undetected_playwright/driver/node
```
</details>

## How to Use

### Adding your resume into the bot:
1. Run the module using `python3 -m intern_bot` in your terminal.
2. This will create a local file named `resume.ini`.
3. Open this file using any text editor and edit the `Skills`, `Certificates`, and `Projects` sections accordingly. Then save it.

### Where to find the internship/Job URL
1. Open any browser and use Incognito Mode (Don't use normal mode, otherwise, you won't be able to copy the internship URL).
2. Go to the internship or job listing website
3. Apply your desired filters such as Profile, Location, Work from Home, Stipend, etc.

4. Now, if you want to apply to multiple internships/jobs at once, then after applying filters:
    * Go to the address bar of the browser and copy the URL.

5. Now, if you want to apply to a specific single internship/job, then after applying the filters:
    * Click on any internship/job you want.
    * It will open in a new tab.
    * Go to that tab and copy the URL from the address bar.

### Final Steps
1. Run the module using the terminal and paste the copied URL from the previous step, such as:    
    `python3 -m intern_bot copied_internship_url`    
    `python3 -m intern_bot copied_job_url`    
    
    Example:  
```bash
python3 -m intern_bot https://example.com/internship/detail/work-from-home-part-time-teaching-assistant-data-science-internship
```

For Job:
```bash
python3 -m intern_bot https://example.com/job/details/fresher-associate-product-manager-job
```

2. Now follow the instructions printed in the terminal.
    - It will ask you to sign in to your accounts.
    - You only need to do this once; next time, it will save the session.

* If you want to apply to multiple internships/jobs, enter the URL copied from step 4.    
    Example:    
    `python3 -m intern_bot https://example.com/internships/work-from-home-data-science-internships/`  

* If you want to apply to multiple individual internships:
    - Copy all the individual internship/job URLs, then enter them one by one.    

    `python3 -m intern_bot internship_one_url internship_two_url internship_three_url`    
    `python3 -m intern_bot job_one_url job_two_url job_three_url`    

After running successfully, it will generate reports in the `reports/` folder in the current directory:
- Application Success Report
- Application Failed Report

## Advanced Options
1. `--skip`, `--skip_assignment_validation`
2. `-f`, `--filters`

* By default, it checks before answering the assignment question if it's easy and answerable by ChatGPT or if it contains any URL or asks for personal info. You can pass the `--skip` or `--skip_assignment_validation` flag to bypass this validation.

Example:
```bash
python3 -m intern_bot internship_url --skip
```

* While applying to multiple internships at once, you can use filters to narrow down the search:
    - To include internships that mention specific keywords in their title:

    ```bash
    python3 -m intern_bot internship_url --filters python sql
    ```
    This will include internships that have "Python" and "SQL" in their titles, in addition to your default search filters.
